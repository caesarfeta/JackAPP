# JackAPP

JackAPP is a JackSON AngularJS application starter-kit.
It was designed to make building linked-data web applications simple.

	* Ontology terms can be modified and not break internal integrity of the application.
		* Developers can concentrate exclusively on building internally consistent data-models.

	* Querying a SPARQL endpoint.
